## TEACHING EXPERIENCE
#### Instructor, Design and Manufacture of Musical Instruments, Spring 2020 & Fall 2018
Tufts University, Department of Mechanical Engineering
* Project based course on designing, building, and analyzing acoustic musical instruments including stringed, wind, and percussion instruments
* Focus on frequency analysis techniques for quantifying the quality of instruments and understanding the physics models governing sound production
* Dissertation research conducted on evaluating the learning outcomes of students in the course
#### Instructor, Engineering and Science for Middle and High School Teachers, Fall 2019
Tufts University, Center for Engineering Education and Outreach
* Course for in service middle and high school teachers interested in bringing engineering into their classrooms
* Project based lab assignments using LEGO Mindstorms to teach control systems and the engineering design process

## RESEARCH
#### Music Acoustics Research, 2017-2019
* Developed new ways to build musical instruments using digital fabrication machines with CAD software apps and innovative applications of materials. I conducted education research after introducing these new methodologies to students from elementary school through university levels, evaluating their learning about engineering and the science of sound as they built their own musical instruments.
* Quantifying the quality of musical instruments by analyzing their frequency response to various inputs and comparing their performance to the preferences of listeners and players. Developed an interface for analyzing frequency content of high speed videos, and used a laser vibrometer to measure the surface vibrations of the top of a violin.
#### Work Under Grants from the LEGO Foundation, 2015-2017
* Spent a month in Denmark as the “maker in residence” at the International School of Billund to help set up a makerspace as part of a grant from the LEGO Foundation.  I ran professional development workshops with teachers in the school to introduce them to the engineering design process and shared ideas with how they could integrate engineering education into their curriculum.  I also worked with student groups participating in the First LEGO League robotics competition in the school.
* Ran workshops and supported teachers during a weeklong intervention focused on musical instrument design with four thousand elementary school students in Denmark.  The summer before, I ran pilot workshops and developed a website, www.BillundBuilds.dk, as a platform for students to share their work with peers and to offer support for teachers participating.  Researchers from the CEEO followed classrooms to evaluate the effectiveness of this hands on learning approach throughout the week of exploration and building.
#### Research Assistant at Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, 2015-2019
* Making an augmented reality interface for a CNC milling machine to allow users to visualize and plan their cuts more easily.  Developed in LabView, the interface generates a drawing of the toolpath created by the user on top of a live feed image of the cutting surface.  The user can drag the drawing around to visualize exactly where on the material they will cut and the mill, calibrated using image processing, will move to the correct starting placement.
* Received a $5,000 CEEO Innovation Grant to develop a concept called Maker Games, a game designed to introduce students to the engineering design process and ways of thinking in a fun way.  A game board allows students to track their progress as they go through the design process and incentivises reflection and documentation of work to bring out the full learning potential of open ended design activities.

## WORK EXPERIENCE
#### Pickup Music Project, Mechanical Design and Education Consultant, Fall 2019 - 2021
* Provided engineering guidance in design and fabrication processes of the “Musical Fence” and “Fluid Process” sound sculptures 
* Designed and implemented innovative curriculum for guiding high school students through designing and building novel sound sculptures that were installed in Cambridge, Massachusetts
#### PTC Inc., Tufts University, Program Manager, 2020 - 2021
Managed all research and development projects funded by a grant from PTC Inc. to Tufts University to explore new ways of coding robots with spacial computing in augmented reality and new methods of teaching CAD in Onshape
Developed interfaces to interact with Onshape's API and guided the research projects of undergraduate interns
#### QRS Music Technologies, Tufts University, Mechanical Design Consultant, Fall 2019
Designed and built a manufacturing prototype of a player violin to be controlled by MIDI commands alongside a player piano
Created a mechanism capable of bowing a violin, tilting the bow to play all four strings, and a system for synthesizing violin sounds with a surface transducer in the violin’s resonating cavity
#### College of Education Schwyz, Switzerland, Curriculum Development Consultant, Summer 2019
Created novel lesson plans and supporting materials for a few three hour long activities to be run in a community makerspace as part of the iMake-It project grant
#### D’Addario & Co., Product Development Intern, Summer 2016
Goal for this project was to collect data from different types of violin strings to try quantitatively characterizing the differences between them
Using a previously developed machine designed to bow the string in a human-like fashion, I developed the procedure for recording and analyzing data in LabVIEW, then tested strings under different combinations of bowing parameters (force, speed, placement)
